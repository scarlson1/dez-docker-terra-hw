[Data Engineering Zoomcamp Docker Terraform Homework](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/cohorts/2026/01-docker-terraform/homework.md)

### Question 1
Run docker with the python:3.13 image. Use an entrypoint bash to interact with the container.

What's the version of pip in the image?

```bash
docker run -it --rm --entrypoint=bash python:3.13
pip --version
```

*25.3*

### Question 2
Given the following docker-compose.yaml, what is the hostname and port that pgadmin should use to connect to the postgres database?

*postgres:5432*

### Question 3
For the trips in November 2025 (lpep_pickup_datetime between '2025-11-01' and '2025-12-01', exclusive of the upper bound), how many trips had a trip_distance of less than or equal to 1 mile?

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.green_trip_data
WHERE 
	lpep_pickup_datetime >= '2025-11-01' 
	AND lpep_pickup_datetime < '2025-12-01'
	AND trip_distance <= 1;
```

*8,007*

### Question 4
Which was the pick up day with the longest trip distance? Only consider trips with trip_distance less than 100 miles (to exclude data errors).

```sql
SELECT lpep_pickup_datetime, trip_distance FROM public.green_trip_data
WHERE trip_distance < 100
ORDER BY trip_distance DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

*2025-11-14*

### Question 5
Which was the pickup zone with the largest total_amount (sum of all trips) on November 18th, 2025?

```sql
SELECT
	zd.zone AS zone_name,
	COUNT(*) AS total_amount 
FROM public.green_trip_data td
JOIN public.zone_data zd
	ON td.pulocationid = zd.locationid
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

*East Harlem North*

### Question 6
For the passengers picked up in the zone named "East Harlem North" in November 2025, which was the drop off zone that had the largest tip?

```sql
SELECT
	zd.zone AS zone_name,
	MAX(td.tip_amount) AS max_tip
FROM public.zone_data zd
JOIN public.green_trip_data td
	ON td.pulocationid = zd.locationid
WHERE zd.zone = 'East Harlem North'
GROUP BY 1
```

*Yorkville West*

### Question 7
Which of the following sequences, respectively, describes the workflow for:

Downloading the provider plugins and setting up backend,
Generating proposed changes and auto-executing the plan
Remove all resources managed by terraform`

*terraform init, terraform apply -auto-approve, terraform destroy*

## Terraform

#### Introduction

1. What is [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io)?
   * open-source tool by [HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com), used for provisioning infrastructure resources
   * supports DevOps best practices for change management
   * Managing configuration files in source control to maintain an ideal provisioning state 
     for testing and production environments
2. What is IaC?
   * Infrastructure-as-Code
   * build, change, and manage your infrastructure in a safe, consistent, and repeatable way 
     by defining resource configurations that you can version, reuse, and share.
3. Some advantages
   * Infrastructure lifecycle management
   * Version control commits
   * Very useful for stack-based deployments, and with cloud providers such as AWS, GCP, Azure, K8S…
   * State-based approach to track resource changes throughout deployments

#### Files

* `main.tf`
* `variables.tf`
* Optional: `resources.tf`, `output.tf`
* `.tfstate`

#### Declarations
* `terraform`: configure basic Terraform settings to provision your infrastructure
   * `required_version`: minimum Terraform version to apply to your configuration
   * `backend`: stores Terraform's "state" snapshots, to map real-world resources to your configuration.
      * `local`: stores state file locally as `terraform.tfstate`
   * `required_providers`: specifies the providers required by the current module
* `provider`:
   * adds a set of resource types and/or data sources that Terraform can manage
   * The Terraform Registry is the main directory of publicly available providers from most major infrastructure platforms.
* `resource`
  * blocks to define components of your infrastructure
  * Project modules/resources: google_storage_bucket, google_bigquery_dataset, google_bigquery_table
* `variable` & `locals`
  * runtime arguments and constants

#### Execution steps
1. `terraform init`: 
    * Initializes & configures the backend, installs plugins/providers, & checks out an existing configuration from a version control 
2. `terraform plan`:
    * Matches/previews local changes against a remote state, and proposes an Execution Plan.
3. `terraform apply`: 
    * Asks for approval to the proposed plan, and applies changes to cloud
4. `terraform destroy`
    * Removes your stack from the Cloud

### Project infrastructure modules in GCP:
* Google Cloud Storage (GCS): Data Lake
* BigQuery: Data Warehouse

(Concepts explained in Week 2 - Data Ingestion)

### Initial Setup

For this course, we'll use a free version (upto EUR 300 credits). 

1. Create an account with your Google email ID 
2. Setup your first [project](https://console.cloud.google.com/) if you haven't already
    * eg. "DTC DE Course", and note down the "Project ID" (we'll use this later when deploying infra with TF)
3. Setup [service account & authentication](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started) for this project
    * Grant `Viewer` role to begin with.
    * Download service-account-keys (.json) for auth.
4. Download [SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart) for local setup
5. Set environment variable to point to your downloaded GCP keys:
   ```shell
   export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="<path/to/your/service-account-authkeys>.json"
   
   # Refresh token/session, and verify authentication
   gcloud auth application-default login
   ```
   
### Setup for Access
 
1. [IAM Roles](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/iam-roles) for Service account:
   * Go to the *IAM* section of *IAM & Admin* https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam
   * Click the *Edit principal* icon for your service account.
   * Add these roles in addition to *Viewer* : **Storage Admin** + **Storage Object Admin** + **BigQuery Admin**
   
2. Enable these APIs for your project:
   * https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/iam.googleapis.com
   * https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/iamcredentials.googleapis.com
   
3. Please ensure `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` env-var is set.
   ```shell
   export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="<path/to/your/service-account-authkeys>.json"
   ```
 
### Execution

```shell
# Refresh service-account's auth-token for this session
gcloud auth application-default login

# Initialize state file (.tfstate)
terraform init

# Check changes to new infra plan
terraform plan -var="project=<your-gcp-project-id>"
```

```shell
# Create new infra
terraform apply -var="project=<your-gcp-project-id>"
```

```shell
# Delete infra after your work, to avoid costs on any running services
terraform destroy
```

### Example `main.tf`

```tf
terraform {
  required_providers {
    google = {
      source  = "hashicorp/google"
      version = "5.6.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "google" {
  credentials = file(var.credentials)
  project     = var.project
  region      = var.region
}


resource "google_storage_bucket" "demo-bucket" {
  name          = var.gcs_bucket_name
  location      = var.location
  force_destroy = true


  lifecycle_rule {
    condition {
      age = 1
    }
    action {
      type = "AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload"
    }
  }
}



resource "google_bigquery_dataset" "demo_dataset" {
  dataset_id = var.bq_dataset_name
  location   = var.location
}
```

### Example `variables.tf`

```t
variable "credentials" {
  description = "My Credentials"
  default     = "<Path to your Service Account json file>"
  #ex: if you have a directory where this file is called keys with your service account json file
  #saved there as my-creds.json you could use default = "./keys/my-creds.json"
}


variable "project" {
  description = "Project"
  default     = "<Your Project ID>"
}

variable "region" {
  description = "Region"
  #Update the below to your desired region
  default     = "us-central1"
}

variable "location" {
  description = "Project Location"
  #Update the below to your desired location
  default     = "US"
}

variable "bq_dataset_name" {
  description = "My BigQuery Dataset Name"
  #Update the below to what you want your dataset to be called
  default     = "demo_dataset"
}

variable "gcs_bucket_name" {
  description = "My Storage Bucket Name"
  #Update the below to a unique bucket name
  default     = "terraform-demo-terra-bucket"
}

variable "gcs_storage_class" {
  description = "Bucket Storage Class"
  default     = "STANDARD"
}
```
